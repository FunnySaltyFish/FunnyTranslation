## Guide to Translating Long Texts

Thank you for using the long text translation feature. In order to make the most of this feature, we recommend that you carefully read the following user guide.

### Function Introduction

The long text translation feature is based on artificial intelligence technology and aims to accurately and fluently translate long texts, while maintaining coherence between the sentences. Unlike the regular translation mode with a limit of several thousand characters, the long text translation feature allows unlimited text translation by segmenting the text. Moreover, to ensure consistency of key terms in the context, we have introduced the concept of "terminology(term)" Each time a segment is translated, the feature identifies the relevant terminology through AI recognition and user intervention, and submits it along with the text to be translated.
Due to cost considerations, the long text translation feature is a paid function, billed based on the number of tokens translated (per thousand tokens). Different models may produce different numbers of tokens after encoding the same text, so please refer to the display on the page. Members can enjoy a certain discount when purchasing, and the specific details are subject to the translation page display.

### How to Use
#### Before Starting

On this page, you will see several sections, including "Source Text," "Task Prompts," "Terminology List," and "Model Selection." You can long-press on the "?" icon next to each title to view specific explanations. Some items can be expanded or collapsed using the button on the far right.

Before clicking the "Start Translation" button, there are a few things you need to do:

- Source Text: If you want to modify it, click on the edit icon.
- Task Prompts: Input the desired target for the model. Here, you can specify the translation language, linguistic style, specific field, etc. The latter part of the prompt cannot be changed as it specifies the output format (shown in gray). The prompt can greatly affect the translation results, so please consider it carefully. It is not recommended to input overly long text as it will increase the cost and may affect the length of the main content, potentially affecting coherence between paragraphs.
    - Possible reference: "You are an excellent translator. I will now give you a fragment of a computer paper. Please translate it into Chinese according to the provided terminology list. Your language should be concise, fluent, and professionally rigorous."
- Terminology List: Here, all the terms are listed. If you want to translate certain words according to specific meanings (e.g., "XiaoWang" -> "小王"), you can click the "Add" button to add them. The terms in the terminology list will affect the translation results, so please consider them carefully.
- Model Selection: Here, all available models are listed, and you can choose one. Different models have different context lengths and prices. Better models have higher prices, so choose according to your needs.

We recommend that you carefully check these items before clicking the "Start Translation" button. A good prompt and terminology list can greatly improve translation quality, while choosing the appropriate model can save costs.

#### During Translation
The terminology list will be continuously updated as the translation progresses. You can delete, add, or edit the list at any time. When one segment of the translation is completed and you are waiting for the next segment to begin, if you are in editing mode at that time, the system will automatically pause until the editing is completed. The edited terminology list cannot affect the completed and ongoing translation results, so please handle it after the translation is finished. You can also click the pause button in the lower right corner at any time to observe the current output.

#### After Translation
The translated results can be exported. Please refer to the specific options.
